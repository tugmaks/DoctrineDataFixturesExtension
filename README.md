Doctrine Fixtures Extension for Behat
=====================================

The extension increases feature test isolation by reloading ORM data fixtures between scenarios and features.

# Installation

This extension requires:

* Behat 3.0+
* Mink 1.4+
* Doctrine ORM 2.x
* [Symfony2Extension](http://extensions.behat.org/symfony2/)

## Through Composer

```sh
composer require "behat-extension/doctrine-data-fixtures-extension"
```

#Configuration

Activate extension in your **behat.yml** and define any fixtures to be loaded:

```yaml
# behat.yml
default:
  # ...
  extensions:
    BehatExtension\DoctrineDataFixturesExtension\Extension:
      lifetime:    feature
      autoload:    true
      directories: ~
      fixtures:    ~
```

When **lifetime** is set to "feature" (or unspecified), data fixtures are reloaded between feature files.  Alternately,
when **lifetime** is set to "scenario", data fixtures are reloaded between scenarios (i.e., increased
test isolation at the expense of increased run time).

When **autoload** is true, the DoctrineDataFixtures extension will load the data fixtures for all
registered bundles (similar to `app/console doctrine:fixtures:load`).

When **fixtures** is set and **autoload** is false, the DoctrineDataFixtures
extension will load the specified fixture classes.

When **directories** is set and **autoload** is false, the DoctrineDataFixtures
extension will load the data fixtures globed from the respective directories.

```yaml
# behat.yml
default:
  # ...
  extensions:
    BehatExtension\DoctrineDataFixturesExtension\Extension:
      lifetime: feature
      autoload: true
      directories:
        - /project/src/AcmeAnalytics/Tests/DataFixtures/ORM
      fixtures:
        - Acme\StoreBundle\DataFixture\ORM\Categories
        - Acme\StoreBundle\DataFixture\ORM\Apps
        - Acme\VendorBundle\DataFixture\ORM\Vendors
```

# Limitations

When using the SqlLiteDriver, the .db file is cached to speed up reloading.  You should periodically clear the cache as it does not detect changes to the data fixture contents because the hash is based on the collection of data fixture class names.
